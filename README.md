# Embedded Systems Roadmap to getting a Job in Industry
The following Roadmap is a work in progress pathway for myself and anyone else to go from 0 to hero in
Embedded Software Engineering.

The Roadmap is meant to be following step by step, however if you already have the skills needed for any of the steps
you should skip forward.

## Main Objectives
1. Learn C.
2. Learn Data Structures and Algorithms.
3. Learn Embedded System Design.
4. Complete 1 ARM Project.
5. Complete 1 Serious Embedded Project.
6. (OPTIONAL) Improve Mathematical Skills.
