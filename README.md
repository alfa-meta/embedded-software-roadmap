# Embedded Systems Roadmap to getting a Job in Industry
The following Roadmap is a work in progress pathway for myself and anyone else to go from 0 to hero in Embedded Software Engineering / IoT.

The Roadmap is meant to be following step by step, however if you already have the skills needed for any of the steps
you should skip forward.

The books and resources used here can be interchanged with other books or updated whenever this list becomes out of date.
The current selection of resources is just that, a current selection. Over time the list will become updated and it is assumed that it will be updated or the reader will have to find suitable alternatives.
